## Game Rules 📜
Slapjack contains the following rules:
* Player must be the first to slap (click on screen) the middle pile to add the cards to their pile
* Cards earned through slapping a Jack first are added to the pile then shuffled before another card is played
* If the middle pile is slapped by a player without a Jack present, a card is burned from the pile (added to the bottom of the middle pile)
* A player wins when the other players' pile is empty
* A draw occurs when both players have empty piles (game is reset)
