## Game Rules
Slapjack contains the following rules:
* Player must be the first to slap (click on screen) the middle pile to add the cards to their pile
* Cards earned through slapping a Jack first are added to the pile then shuffled before another card is played
* If the middle pile is slapped by a player without a Jack present, a card is burned from the pile (added to the bottom of the middle pile)
* A player wins when the other players' pile is empty
* A draw occurs when both players have empty piles (game is reset)

* Middle Pile contains the played cards in a pile
* The number of cards is displayed under the face-up cards
* On the side of the pile is text that gives a brief description about what move has played (or is in progress)


### Functionality
* Player must tap their face-down deck when it is their turn (cannot play when Machine turn)
* When a card is played, the card count of the player and the pile count is updated
* If a Jack appears, then the player must tap the middle pile within a randomly generated time otherwise middle pile goes to machine
  * Time is between 100 milliseconds to 2 seconds
  * Middle pile is cleared after it goes to one of the players
* If the player taps the middle pile when there is no Jack or after the machine "clicks" the middle pile, then they must burn a card (goes to the bottom of the pile)
